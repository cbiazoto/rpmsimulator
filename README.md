# ESP32 Arduino RPM Simulator
This project creates an RPM simulator with two pulses that work synchronized or alternating.
The pulses can also be run in rising or falling.
It also has fine timing adjustment for greater accuracy.
Originally this project was created using ESP32 but it can be used by any processor that uses arduino ide and has inputs and outputs necessary for RPM control.
